## Features
* **Zero functionality:** It opens. You can type. That's about it.
* **Visual assault:** Guaranteed to look out of place in any desktop environment.
* **Highly unoptimized:** Uses the most powerful modern libraries to do absolutely nothing special.
* **Minimalist (by accident):** No tabs, no split-screen, no settings, no soul.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following bloated dependencies to run this lightweight masterpiece:
*`gtk4`
*`libadwaita-1`
*`vte-2.91-gtk4`
*`gcc` & `make`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository (if you really have nothing better to do):
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holy.sh.git
cd holy.sh
```
2. Compile the mess:
```Bash
make
```
3. System-wide regret (Install):
```Bash
sudo make install
```

## Support
Don't contact me. I don't know how it works either.
